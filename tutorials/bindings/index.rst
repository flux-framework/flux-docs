Language Bindings
=================

We provide this set of external tutorials as complete project setups that demonstrate
using Flux from a different language, or (TBA) natively with C. Each of these tutorial
repositories provides:

 - A set of common use case examples or snippets 🗒️
 - A build setup for compiling the snippets 🏗️
 - A Developer environment (e.g., VSCode Devcontainers) for easy development 🐟️
 - Continuous integration with an automated container build and testing ⚙️
 - A web interface that renders the most up-to-date snippets 🖼️

Thus, it should be easy for you to fork or clone any repository, and get started with your
custom project that interacts with Flux.

 - ``Go Bindings``: `flux-go <https://github.com/converged-computing/flux-go/>`_

These are a work in progress, and we ask you to `let us know <https://github.com/flux-framework/flux-docs/issues>`_ 
if you have requests for examples, and please comment on the respective respositories above with 
questions about any specific lagnuage.
