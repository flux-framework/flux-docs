Command Tutorials
=================

Welcome to the Command Tutorials! These tutorials should help you to map specific Flux commands
with your use case, and then see detailed usage.

 - ``flux submit/flux run`` (:ref:`flux-submit`): "Submit a job in a Flux instance"
 - ``flux jobs`` (:ref:`flux-jobs`): "List Flux jobs, filter them, and output extra information"
 - ``flux proxy`` (:ref:`ssh-across-clusters`): "Send commands to a Flux instance across clusters using ssh"

This section is currently ЁЯЪзя╕П under construction ЁЯЪзя╕П, so please come back later to see more command tutorials!
