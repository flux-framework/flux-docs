Debugging Jobs 
==============

Flux supports parallel debuggers such as Rogue Wave Software (RWS)'s
`TotalView parallel debugger <https://totalview.io>`_.

----------------------------------
Parallel Debugging using TotalView
----------------------------------

Debugging your MPI job from the beginning of
parallel program execution:

.. code-block:: console

  $ totalview --args flux run -N 2 -n 2 ./mpi-program

Attaching to an already running job:

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux job attach --debug <JOBID> &
  $ PID=$!
  $ totalview -pid ${PID} /proc/${PID}/exe

You can also just type ``totalview`` without ``-pid`` option 
For Classic UI: use its ``Start a Debugging Session``
GUI option to select the process of this ``flux-job`` command:
``A running program (attach)``.
For new UI: use ''Attach To Process''

.. note::
  You use TotalView with the newly invoked ``flux job attach``
  when your job has been launched via ``flux run`` (or ``flux submit``).
  This is because Flux currently does not allow TotalView
  to attach to your running code if you just attach it
  to the ``flux run`` process that controls your code. For
  performance reasons, ``flux run`` does not generate
  sufficient debug information when it is invoked with no tool control.

Flux provides ``MPIR_partial_attach_ok`` `[1] <https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpir-specification-10-11-2010.pdf>`_
so you can attach TotalView to a subset of parallel processes as well, which
can be handy when you debug a large-scale job. Please refer to
`TotalView user guide`_ on its subset-attach capability.

.. _TotalView user guide: https://docs.roguewave.com/en/totalview/current/html/

Exiting TotalView without completing a full run of your code, may not clean up the Flux job. 
In that case you will need to cancel the flux job manually. 

.. code-block:: console

  $ flux cancel <JOBID>

.. note::
  Use ``flux jobs`` to find <JOBID>

----------------------------------------------
Better Handling of Flux's Internal Exec Events
----------------------------------------------

Flux executes a series of subcommands before launching
your parallel program.
Thus, a side effect of the above commands is that TotalView
will stop Flux's own program execution each time
a new subcommand is ``exec(3)``'ed (e.g., when ``flux`` ``exec``'s
``flux-run``) before your parallel program processes are spawned.
This means you must manually click "Yes" whenever a stop-at-exec
dialogue window is popped up. You do not need to stop
it unless you are a Flux developer!
Instead, you can make TotalView automatically
continue on these events by building the the following
exec-handling Tcl code into TotalView::

    catch {dset TV::exec_handling { {^(flux|lrun|srun|jsrun)(<python[^>]*>(<flux-job>)?|<bash>|<jsrun>|<jswrap>)*$ go}} }

This code has been added to the site-wide ``.tvdrc`` file
to enable this for all TotalView sessions
or per-user file (e.g., ``tvdrc`` in the current working directory)
to enable this only for the user's own sessions.
For the latter case, you should provide ``-s tvdrc`` option
to ``totalview``. For example,

.. code-block:: console

  $ totalview -s tvdrc --args flux run -N 2 -n 2 ./mpi-program

Notice that it is designed to support not only Flux but also SLURM's
srun and IBM JSM's jsrun commands. The ``regex`` syntax of
``exec_handling`` within TotalView can be found in `TotalView user guide`_.


------------
Known Issues
------------
Parallel debugging support within Flux is new and we are working with
tool builders to mature our functionality further. This section documents
some of known limitations.

1. Depending on how the site configured TotalView,
the parallel program may not stop at the first instruction
to allow TotalView to debug them from the beginning of execution.
For performance reasons, TotalView can be configured
not to stop and process dynamic libraries and this
can cause this issue. RWS is actively looking
at this issue.
